Analyze a Phishing Email Sample.
	
•	Familiarize yourself with phishing attacks

•	Phishing attacks use deceptive emails, texts, or calls to trick you into revealing sensitive information, like passwords or financial details, by pretending to be legitimate companies or people.
•	These attacks exploit human psychology and can occur through various channels, including emails, text messages, and fake websites. 


•	What is phishing?

•	Phishing is a type of cyberattack where attackers use social engineering to manipulate you into sharing personal or financial information. 

•	They do this by sending messages that appear to be from trusted sources, such as banks, popular websites, or even friends and family. 


•	These messages often contain links to fake websites, which are designed to steal your login credentials or other sensitive data.


                                              
•	Learn to spot phishing emails.

•	Suspicious Sender Information: 
•	Check the sender's email address for misspellings or unusual domains, even if the display name looks legitimate. 

•	Generic Greetings: 
•	Legitimate companies rarely use "Dear Customer" or other vague greetings in their communications. 

•	Spelling and Grammar Errors: 
•	Look for poor grammar, typos, and unnatural language, which are common in phishing emails. 

•	Urgent or Threatening Tone: 
•	Attackers often create a sense of urgency or fear to prompt you to act quickly without thinking. 

•	Questionable Links and Attachments: 
•	Never click on links or open attachments in unexpected messages. You can verify a link's legitimacy by hovering your mouse over it to see the actual URL. 

•	Too-Good-To-Be-True Offers: 
•	Be skeptical of offers that seem unreasonable or too good to be true. 
 
•	Example of Phishing Email.

 

•	Observations.
1.	The first thing to notice in this CEO phishing email example is the sender’s email doesn’t match the email in their email signature.

	Sender Mail Add- jbrownstown@hi-tech-c0rp.test
	Email signature -jbrownstown@hi-tech-corp.test

2.	The classic tactic of urgency is employed, giving the recipient little time to consider the request.
•	“Transfer payment that needs to be processed ASAP”.

3.	There are also grammatical errors and an unusual tone of voice—e.g., the CEO likely wouldn’t use formal language like “please find enclosed” to a CFO with whom he works closely.

	How do we stop getting phished?

•	Be Wary of Unsolicited Messages: 
•	Exercise caution with any unsolicited communication that requests personal or financial information. 

•	Verify Information Independently: 
•	If you receive a suspicious message, do not use the contact information provided in the message. Instead, use a known phone number or website to contact the company directly and verify their request. 

•	Use Strong Security Measures: 
•	Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your accounts to add an extra layer of security. 

•	Keep Software Updated: 
•	Regularly update your antivirus software and other security software to protect against malware and other threats. 

•	Stay Informed: 
•	Education is a critical defense; stay knowledgeable about common phishing tactics
